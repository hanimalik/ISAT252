## Hani Malik's Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! My name is Hani Malik, an ISAT major at JMU. I created this website for a couple of reasons. One to test and see how well I can use GitHub Pages, and two, because I had to for an assignment. Read below to learn more about me and browse my website!

### Who am I/Where am I from?

So, where am I from? My parents are both Pakistani and were born there, while I myself was born here in the US. I was born in Shady Grove, MD and grew up nearby in Germantown, MD until I was about 6 or 7. I then moved along with my family to Arlington, VA and have lived there ever since. I have been in the DMV my entire life. Some of my favorite hobbies include:
- Playing guitar and creating my own riifs/songs
- Listening to music (and discovering new music)
-
