## Hani Malik's Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! My name is Hani Malik, an ISAT major at JMU. I created this website for a couple of reasons. One to test and see how well I can use GitHub Pages, and two, because I had to for an assignment. Read below to learn more about me and browse my website!

### Where Am I From?

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/hanimalik/ISAT252/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
